## About Me

Just a former biologist who got bored enough with Excel to start writing scripts to automate that process. Next thing, I'm optimizing floating-point parsers cross-compiled to a Raspberry Pi. Thinking is overrated and we should do less of it.

All of my projects are done on my own time, and are not related to my day job, so I appreciate your understanding that reviewing and merging PRs and feature enhancements may take some time.

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=rust,python,cpp,docker,nodejs,qt,dotnet,cmake,selenium,mongodb,vue,html,css,linux,bash)](https://skillicons.dev)

A few of my accomplishments:
- Author of the Rust core library float [parser][rust-lang-pr].
- Creator of [rust-lexical], which implements fast float parsing and writing algorithms, used in [jiter], [arrow], [rust-python], [databend], (formerly [polars]) and more.
- Designed the [digit comparison algorithm][digit-comparison] for unambiguous floating-point parsing for near-halfway cases, used in [fast float][fast-float] and [rust-lexical].
- Designed stylish, customizable light and dark Qt [stylesheets][breeze-stylesheets].
- Maintainer for [cross-rs], for minimal setup cross-compilation on Rust.
- Maintainer of a fork of [fast-float] with security patches, used in [polars] and more..
- is unable to think during the summer heat.

Some other notable projects using lexical include:
- [hifitime]
- [merde]
- [noodles]
